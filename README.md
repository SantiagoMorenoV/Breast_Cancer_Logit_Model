## Breast Cancer Tumor Classification

This project utilizes the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/15/breast+cancer+wisconsin+original "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Original)") dataset to predict whether a breast cancer tumor is malignant or benign using a logistic regression model. The dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. This project aims to demonstrate the application of logistic regression as a classifier in data science, with potential applications in various fields, including medical diagnostics.

## Logit Model
